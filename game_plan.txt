Here is the comprehensive plan for implementing the point system in the Pong game:

### Plan:

1. **Update `game.js`:**
   - **Add Scoring Variables:**
     - Introduce variables to keep track of the scores for both players.
   - **Modify the `reset` Method:**
     - Update the `reset` method to check if either player has reached 5 points. If so, display a message indicating the winner and stop the game loop.
   - **Implement Key Listener for Restart:**
     - Add an event listener to detect when the 'R' key is pressed to reset the game and scores.
   - **Display Winner Message:**
     - Create a function to display the winner's message in red font on the canvas.

2. **Update `pong.html`:**
   - Ensure that the canvas is appropriately sized to display the winner's message.

3. **Update `style.css`:**
   - Add styles for the winner's message to ensure it appears in red font.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Test the game to ensure the scoring system and restart functionality work as expected.
